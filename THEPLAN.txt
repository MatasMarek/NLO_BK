-------- THE PLAN --------

#### Logical structure of the code
    Start with an input file like in QE. This file will set the variables in the calculation (keep variable voluntary):
        * Dimensionality of N
        * Form of the initial condition
        * Integration method (MC/Simpson)
        * Order of RK method?
        * The grid
        * Order of the BK equation (LO/NLO)

#### File system
    * Kernels
    * Initial condition
    * Running coupling
    * Integrators
    * Interpolation
    * I/O functions

#### Remarks:
    * Git and versioning!
    * Make the code parallelizable on the highest level
    * WRITE IT SUCH THAT ALL THE VARIABLES ARE VOLUNTARY! EXPANDING THE CODE WILL NOT LEAD TO MALFUNCTION

#### Does it scale for multiple dimentions?
    * Need to keep vectorized
    * Need to keep general interpolation methods
    * Needs to work for:
        1. N(r,Y)
        2. N(r, b, Y)
        3. N(r, b, theta, Y)
        4. N(r, b, theta, phi, Y)

QUESTIONS:
    * How to paralellize?
    * Cartesian or polar?
